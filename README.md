# Add-to-cart-public
The public version of an app that my family uses to go shopping without forgetting anything.

The purpose of the app is to share the shopping list with the person in charge of going to the store or place of purchase. This person will check and eliminate the items on the list until completing the purchase of all items ordered.

### How to use Add-to-cart-public
You can access to the [URL](https://add-to-cart-public.vercel.app/) and add items to shopping list typing the product in the input field and pressing the Add to cart button (or simply pressing intro if you wish). When you buy a product, can press its name and eliminate it from the list.
A pop-up circle will appear near the image of the man with the cart with the number of products currently in the list.
It's important to note that it's the public version. Thus, everyone accessing the URL will be able to add or remove items from the same shared list. Anyone can remove items that you've added, and you can remove items that anyone else has added.

### Technologies used during development of this app
* HTML - Web
* CSS - Styles
* JavaScript - Logic
* Firebase - Database management

For the deployment, the Webpack-dotenv package was used as a packer and manager of environment variables.

### Greetings and thanks
Obviously, I spent some time on this app. However, the basic idea and motivation were taken from the video tutorial given by Rafid Hoda [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFD4SP91tSM). Despite being simple, I am happy because this app has been very useful for me and my family.
